 If requirements are ambiguous or multiple interpretations exist: list options + ask 1 question OR pick safest option and state assumption.
- Keep changes minimal: no refactors, no formatting sweeps, no unrelated cleanup.
- Prefer simplest working code: no speculative abstractions or extra features.
- Before editing: identify exact file+location (search/read first). Don’t edit blind.
- Definition of done: run the project’s tests/lint (or stated check) and report results.
- Trivial tasks (<= ~10 LOC, 1 file, clear): skip long planning; still follow “minimal change + verify”.
