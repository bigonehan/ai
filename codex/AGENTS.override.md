## Global Pre-Read Requirement
  Before starting any task in this scope, always read `/home/tree/ai/doc/guide.md` first.

  - Treat `/home/tree/ai/doc/guide.md` as mandatory baseline instructions.
  - If it conflicts with deeper scoped `AGENTS.md`, follow the deeper scoped file for that scope.
  - If the file cannot be read, report that immediately and stop before making changes.
